Biofilms are colonies of bacteria bounded by a polymeric extracellular matrix, and they 
are prevalent in environmental, industrial, and health settings. Much of the molecular
mechanisms for biofilm growth and formation are still unclear, in particular how cells switch
phenotypes, i.e. their cell type. To understand this switch, we focus on the Bacillus subtilis (B.
subtilis) strain. Experimental evidence shows that phosphorylated Spo0A (Spo0A-P) is the master 
regulator determining cell phenotype. The genetic network of B. subtilis leading to
Spo0A-P production is affected by environmental factors, specifically nutrients and quorum
sensing. We construct a nested incoherent feed-forward loop to represent the genetic
network of B. subtilis, integrating both nutrient and quorum sensing pathways. A system of
coupled ordinary differential equations models our genetic network, and dynamical systems
analysis reveals that starvation raises Spo0A-P levels and initiates sporulation. This simple
model of the B. subtilis genetic network is the first step in understanding the growth mechanisms
of biofilms in response to environmental conditions.
